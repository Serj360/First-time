# 🌱 FAQ / Common Questions

Welcome, and thank you for coming! Every day, I dedicate a bit of my personal time to keep these notes up to date. I hope you enjoy reading them as much as I enjoyed making them! Please feel free to reach out to me personally with any questions or feedback. Thank you!

### 1️⃣ **What is this place?**

- This is where I document all my IT experience in one central hub using my favorite tool, [Notion](https://www.notion.so/Sergio-s-Welcome-Page-29843cea684480a8b9a4df2816396e74?pvs=21). Its like my personal Wiki.
- I record all work and projects here for career purposes.

### 2️⃣ **What’s the reason for making this?**

> *“Getting experience without documenting your work is like going to the Gym and not tracking your progress”*
> 
- In IT, much of the work is intangible, making it difficult for employers to assess skills by words alone without going through a trial period.
- A portfolio allows them to see concrete evidence of my abilities, avoiding that initial risk.
- It also reinforces anything I’ve previously articulated; sometimes I can’t recall every detail, and having a documented hub keeps my knowledge fresh.
- Don’t just take my word for it, here are some sources:
    - *“Personal projects and home labs in IT improve hands-on skills, problem-solving, and critical thinking”*  ([invent.org](https://www.invent.org/blog/trends-stem/benefit-from-hands-on-learning?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
    - *“Employers value them as tangible evidence, giving candidates a competitive edge and strong portfolio for jobs and interviews”* ([dice.com](https://www.dice.com/career-advice/using-personal-projects-to-land-your-first-job-in-tech?utm_source=chatgpt.com),[profiletree.com](https://profiletree.com/personal-projects/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
    - *“Home labs also let you safely experiment with systems and prepare for certifications“* ([stormagic.com](https://stormagic.com/company/blog/what-is-homelab/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
