# 🌱 FAQ / Common Questions

Welcome, and thanks for stopping by! This README gives an overview of my work, projects, and documentation habits.
I also maintain a Notion-based portfolio that's more visual and it also includes labs, and ongoing learning.

➡️ [My Notion Portfolio](https://www.notion.so/sergiomontoya360/29843cea684480e3b26ef4c36cc4d7ac?v=29843cea6844803481d4000ced637e12&source=copy_link)


### 1️⃣ **What is this place?**

- This GitHub + Notion setup is my personal knowledge base—essentially my own Wiki.
- I use Notion to document IT experience, projects, and workflows so everything lives in one organized hub.
- GitHub hosts my public-facing code, notes, and project files, while Notion provides the structured “portfolio” view.

### 2️⃣ **What’s the reason for making this?**

> *“Getting experience without documenting your work is like going to the Gym and not tracking your progress”*
> 
- IT work is often intangible. Documentation lets employers see real, verifiable skill—not just claims.
- A portfolio reduces the “risk” for hiring managers by showing how I think, troubleshoot, and execute projects.
- It also reinforces information I’ve learned; not everything sticks unless it’s written, organized, and reviewed.
- A few supporting sources:
    - *“Personal projects and home labs in IT improve hands-on skills, problem-solving, and critical thinking”*  ([invent.org](https://www.invent.org/blog/trends-stem/benefit-from-hands-on-learning?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
    - *“Employers value them as tangible evidence, giving candidates a competitive edge and strong portfolio for jobs and interviews”* ([dice.com](https://www.dice.com/career-advice/using-personal-projects-to-land-your-first-job-in-tech?utm_source=chatgpt.com),[profiletree.com](https://profiletree.com/personal-projects/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
    - *“Home labs also let you safely experiment with systems and prepare for certifications“* ([stormagic.com](https://stormagic.com/company/blog/what-is-homelab/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

### 3️⃣ **What is Notion?**

- Notion is a workspace where you can build pages, wikis, databases, and project documentation.
